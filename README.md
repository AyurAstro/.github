"Ayur" is a version of the Sanskrit word for life. "Astro" is a rough shorthand for all things astrological, astronomical, astral, stellar, and starry. The name AyurAstro is meant to convey the great appreciation Renay has for the spark of life, its rhythms and forms, its dances and dramas, and its instructions and wisdom.
